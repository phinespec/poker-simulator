# PokerSim

A poker training tool that's also a game
Instead of being an active player at a poker table
you are betting on which player and which hand will win each round
Depending on how early you place your bet, you risk more. Thus the
later you bet, the less risk, however you will win a lot less, as the
stakes are much lower.

If you do well, you'll be rewarded with bonuses and special abilities
which allow you to further manipulate your bet or the cards themselves.
